				Surveys reveal that people with disabilities consistently report a good quality of life,
				says Tom Shakespeare. So why is it often assumed they are unhappy? 
				Have you ever thought to yourself:
				"I'd rather be dead than disabled?" It's not an unusual reflection.  
				Disability, in everyday thought, is associated with failure,  
				with dependency and with not being able to do things.
				We feel sorry for disabled people, because we imagine it must be miserable to be disabled. 
				But in fact we're wrong. It's sometimes called the "disability paradox".  
				Surveys reveal people with disabilities consistently report a quality of life as good as,  
				or sometimes even better than, that of non-disabled people.
